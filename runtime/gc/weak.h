 * Weak objects have the following layout:
 * 
 * header word ::
 * unused word ::
 * link word ::
 * heap-pointer
 *
 * The object type indexed by the header determines whether the weak
 * is valid or not.  If the type has numPointers == 1, then the weak
 * pointer is valid.  Otherwise, the type has numPointers == 0 and the
 * weak pointer is not valid.
 *
 * The first word is unused; present for alignment purposes
 *
 * The second word is used to chain the live weaks together during a copying gc
 * and is otherwise unused.
 *
 * The third word is the weak pointer.
