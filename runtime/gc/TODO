* reorder ZZZ_TYPE_INDEX
* eliminate STRING_TYPE_INDEX, STRING_TYPE_HEADER in favor or WORD8.
* fix semantics of numNonPointers for normal objects to mean bytes of
        non-pointer data, rather than number of 32-bit words of
        non-pointer data.  Rename to sizeNonPointers.
* the unused field in GC_weak appears to be for alignment; is there a
        way to have it work well with 64-bits?  Yes -- it requires
        choosing the representation for Weaks based on the model and
        the alignment; also, the GC will need to bump the pointer to
        the word after the header to get GC_weak to overlay properly.
* what type should be used for the size field in GC_heap?  I'm using
        size_t currently, since that is the type needed by malloc.
* I don't believe the comment concerning exnStack and the native
        codegen in thread.h is still true; it used to be the case when
        GC_switchToThread was implemented in codegens.  Now it should
        be implemented in Backend.
* the "skipObjects" loop in forwardInterGenerationalObjptrs appears to
        be unnecessary.
