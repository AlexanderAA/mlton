* fix semantics of numNonPointers for normal objects to mean bytes of
        non-pointer data, rather than number of 32-bit words of
        non-pointer data.  Rename to sizeNonPointers.
* what type should be used for the size field in GC_heap?  I'm using
        size_t currently, since that is the type needed by malloc.
* the "skipObjects" loop in forwardInterGenerationalObjptrs appears to
        be unnecessary.
* Why does hash-table use malloc/free while generational maps use mmap/munmap?
