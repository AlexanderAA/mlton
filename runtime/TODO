* what type should be used for the size field in GC_heap?  I'm using
        size_t currently, since that is the type needed by malloc.
* Why does hash-table use malloc/free while generational maps use mmap/munmap?

* Use C99 <assert.h> instead of util/assert.{c,h}


Rename primitives to indicate that these are not bit-wise identities
  Real_toWord
  Real_toReal
  Word_toReal
and add primitives
  Real_toWord, Word_toReal
that correspond to bit-wise identities.
