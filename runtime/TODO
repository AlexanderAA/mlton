* what type should be used for the size field in GC_heap?  I'm using
        size_t currently, since that is the type needed by malloc.
* Why does hash-table use malloc/free while generational maps use mmap/munmap?

* Use C99 <assert.h> instead of util/assert.{c,h}

Replace Word8{Array,Vector}_{sub,update}{,Rev} primitives with
PackWord{8,16,32,64}_{sub,update}{,Rev} primitives; possibly refine
the semantics to use index offset rather than byte offset (the
advantage of index offset is that we can take advantage of scaling in
address modes).

Avoid  SysWord.fromLarge o C_UId.toLarge  conversions.


Rename primitives to indicate that these are not bit-wise identities
  Real_toWord
  Real_toReal
  Word_toReal
and add primitives
  Real_toWord, Word_toReal
that correspond to bit-wise identities.
