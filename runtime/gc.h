 * Header word bits look as follows:
 * 31		mark bit
 * 30 - 20	counter bits
 * 19 - 1	type index bits
 * 0		1
 *
 * The mark bit is used by the mark compact GC and GC_size to mark an object
 * as reachable.  The counter bits are used during the mark phase in conjunction
 * with pointer reversal to implement the mark stack.  They record the current
 * pointer
 *
 * The type index is an index into an array of struct GC_ObjectType's, where 
 * each element describes the layout of an object.  There are three kinds of
 * objects: array, normal, and stack.
 *
 * Arrays are layed out as follows
 *   counter word
 *   length word
 *   header word
 *   data words ...
 * The counter word is used during marking to help implement the mark stack.
 * The length word is the number of elements in the array.
 * The header word contains a type index that describes the layout of elements.
 * For now, arrays are either all pointers or all nonpointers.
 * 
 * Normal objects are a header word followed by the data words, which consist
 * of all nonpointer data followed by all pointer data.  
 *
 * 19 bits means that there are only 2^19 different different object layouts,
 * which appears to be plenty, since there were < 128 different types required
 * for a self-compile.
