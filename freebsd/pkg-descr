This is a port of MLton, the whole-program optimizing Standard ML Compiler.
MLton runs on x86 machines with Linux, FreeBSD, or Cygwin/Windows. MLton
generates excellent code, has a fast C FFI, profiling, and many useful
libraries, including an interface to the GNU multiprecision library.  For more
information, go to the MLton home page.
