# This script adds a new crosscompiler target for MLton.
# You may need to set installLibDir, crossHost, or cygwin.
# This script builds an executable in the current directory that you must
# run on the target machine.  This executable prints on standard output
# the values of the compile time constants needed by the MLton when 
# cross compiling.  You must place the output of running the executable in
# $libDir/$crossHost/constants.

# libDir is the mlton lib directory where you would like the 
# cross-compiler information to be installed.  If you have installed from the
# rpms, this will usually be /usr/local/lib/mlton.  You must have write 
# permission there. 

lib="$src/build/lib"

# crossHost will be used via the -b flag passed to the GCC cross-compiler tools.
# You must already have installed the GCC cross-compiler tools.  This script
# does not do that, although you may find the script build-cross-gcc helpful.
# crossHost here should be the same as target in build-cross-gcc.
crossHost='i386-pc-cygwin'

# There are two possible types for the target machine: cygwin and linux. 
# It should be obvious which of those you want.

crossType='cygwin'

# You shouldn't need to change anything below this line.
