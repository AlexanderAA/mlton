This directory contains the MLton implementation of the Basis Library.
The files are grouped in directories in the same way that the
corresponding modules are grouped in the basis library documentation.
All other implementation files are in the misc/ and libs/ directories.

The basis is constructed in two steps.  First, all of the files in
libs/build are concatenated together and evaluated to produce an
environment E.  Then, depending on compile time options, all of the
files in libs/basis-*/bind evaluated in the environment E to produce a
new environment E', which is the top-level environment.

Another way to view it is that every program is prefixed by the
following program.

local
  <concatenate files in libs/build>
in
  <concatenate files in libs/basis-*/bind>
end

This is not strictly accurate because some of the files are not
Standard ML (see below) and because Standard ML does not allow local
functor or signature declarations.

Other than bind-basis and build-basis, there are several special files:

misc/primitive.sml
posix/primitve.sml
  These are not Standard ML. They describe all of the primitives and
  C routines used in the basis. 
  
top-level/overloads.sml
  Not Standard ML.
  Uses the notation _overload <var> : <ty> as <var> (and <var>)*


Dead Code Elimination
----------------------------------------
In order to compile small programs rapidly, a pass of dead code
elimination (core-ml/dead-code.{sig,fun}) is run in order to eliminate
as much of the basis library as possible.  The dead code elimination
algorithm used is not safe in general, and only works because the
basis library implementation has special properties:
  * it terminates
  * it performs no I/O
The dead code elimination includes the minimal set of
declarations from the basis so that their are no free variables in the
user program (or basis).  It has a special hack to include all
bindings of the form 
	
	val _ = ...
