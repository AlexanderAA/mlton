      <li> <a href =
		  "http://types.bu.edu/reports/Dim+Wes+Mul+Tur+Wel+Con:TIC-2000-LNCS.html">CIL</a>, a compiler for SML, uses MLton as a defunctorizer.
      <li> <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~concert/">ConCert</a>, a
	    project investigating certified code for grid computing,
	    uses MLton to build some of their front-end software.
      <li> Dan Wang and Andrew Appel showed how to modify MLton to
				    generate a strongly typed garbage 
				    collector as part of a program
				    in their paper <a href =
	  "http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danwang/Papers/tpsrvgc/">Type-Preserving
	  Garbage Collectors</a>.
