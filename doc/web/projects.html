    We have lots of ideas for projects to improve MLton, many of which we do not
    have time to implement, or at least haven't started on yet.  Here is a list
    of some of those improvements, ranging from the easy (1 week) to the
    difficult (several months).  If you have any interest in working on one of
    these, or some other improvement to MLton not listed here, please send mail
    to <tt>MLton@mlton.org</tt>.

    <ul> 
      <li> Port to new platform: Windows, Mac OSX, x86-64, ...
      <li> Proper front end
      <li> Source-level debugger
      <li> Support calling SML from C
      <li> Heap profiler
      <li> Support NLFFI
      <li> Interfaces to libraries: Gtk, OpenGL, ...
      <li> Additional constant types: Int64, Real32, Real80, Word64, ...
      <li> Use Int64 for file positions
      <li> Support CML
	<br> The support for threads and signals is already there, so
	it shouldn't be too hard to change the uses of callcc to
	MLton.thread.switch.  Harder is thinking about how to make MLton's
	libraries thread safe.
      <li> Port MLRISC and use for code generation
      <li> Optimizations
	<ul>
	  <li>Improved closure representation
	    <br>
	    Right now, MLton's closure conversion algorithm uses a simple flat
	    closure to represent each function.
          <li> Array, ref, and vector flattening
	  <li> Elimination of array bounds checks in loops
	  <li> Elimination of overflow checks on array index computations
	  <li> Common-subexpression elimination of repeated array subscripts
	  <li> Loop-invariant code motion, especially for tuple selects
	</ul>
	     
    </ul>
