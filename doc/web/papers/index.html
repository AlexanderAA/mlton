    Here are papers that we have written describing parts of MLton.

    <ul>
    <li><a href = "01-icfp.ps.gz">Contification Using Dominators</a>
    <br>Matthew Fluet and Stephen Weeks
    <br>International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), September
    2001. 
    <br>
    <em>
      This paper describes contification, a generalization of tail-recursion
      elimination that is an optimization operating on MLton's static single
	    assignment (SSA) intermediate language.
    </em>

    <li>
    <a href = "00-esop.ps.gz">Flow-directed Closure Conversion for Typed
      Languages</a>
      <br>Henry Cejtin, Suresh Jagannathan, and Stephen Weeks
      <br>European Symposium on Programming (ESOP), March/April 2000.
    (part of <a href = 
	"http://iks.cs.tu-berlin.de/etaps2000/etaps.html">ETAPS</a>)
    <br>
    <em>
      This paper describes MLton's closure-conversion algorithm, which
		    translates from its simply-typed higher-order intermediate
		    language to its simply-typed first-order intermediate
		    language.
    </em>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Here are some papers that others have written that relate to MLton
	  in some way.
    <ul>
    <li><a href =
	  "http://www.daimi.au.dk/CPnets/workshop99/papers/Mortensen.ps.gz">Automatic Code Generation from Coloured Petri Nets for an Access Control System</a>
    <li> <a href = "http://user.it.uu.se/~happi/publications/flops02.pdf">The
	      HiPE/x86 Erlang Compiler: System Description and Performance
	      Evaluation</a>
         <br> <em>Describes a native x86 Erlang compiler and a comparison of
		  many different native x86 compilers (including MLton) and their
		  register usage and call stack implementations.</em>
    <li> <a href = "http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/papers/wang-murphy-recursion.pdf">Programming With Recursion Schemes</a>
        <br> <em>Describes a programming technique for data abstraction, along
				with benchmarks of MLton and other SML
				compilers.</em> 
    <li> <a href =
	    "http://ncstrl.cs.princeton.edu/expand.php?id=TR-640-01">Managing Memory with Types</a>
         <br> <em>Chapter 6 discusses an implementation of a
			    type-preserving garbage collector for MLton.</em>
    <li> <a href =
	    "http://www.lri.fr/~signoles/publis/jfla2003.ps.gz">Calcul
			  statique des applications de modules
			  param&#233;tr&#233s </a>
        <br> <em>Describes a defunctorizer for OCaml, and compares it to existing
			  defunctorizers, including MLton.</a>
    </ul>
