    Here are papers that we have written describing parts of MLton.

    <p><a href = "01-icfp.ps.gz">Contification Using Dominators</a>
    <br>Matthew Fluet and Stephen Weeks
    <br>International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), September
    2001. 
    <br>
    <em>
      This paper describes contification, a generalization of tail-recursion
      elimination that is an optimization operating on MLton's static single
	    assignment (SSA) intermediate language.
    </em>

    <p>
    <a href = "00-esop.ps.gz">Flow-directed Closure Conversion for Typed
      Languages</a>
      <br>Henry Cejtin, Suresh Jagannathan, and Stephen Weeks
      <br>European Symposium on Programming (ESOP), March/April 2000.
    (part of <a href = 
	"http://iks.cs.tu-berlin.de/etaps2000/etaps.html">ETAPS</a>)
    <br>
    <em>
      This paper describes MLton's closure-conversion algorithm, which
		    translates from its simply-typed higher-order intermediate
		    language to its simply-typed first-order intermediate
		    language.
