    20020410, include:

    <ul>
      <li> Major runtime system improvements.  The runtime now implements
      mark-compact and generational collection, in addition to the copying
      collection that was there before.  It automatically switches between the
      the collection strategies to improve performance and to try to avoid
      paging.

      <li> Performance when compiling "-exn-history true" has been improved.

      <li> Added <tt>IntInf.log2</tt>, <tt>MLton.GC.pack</tt>, and
	    <tt>MLton.GC.unpack</tt>. 

      <li> Fixed bug in load world that could cause <tt>sread failed</tt> on 
	      Cygwin.
      <li> Fixed optimizer bug that could cause </tt> no analyze var value
		property</tt> message. 
    </ul>
