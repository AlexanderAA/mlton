    <title>Improvements to MLton</title>

  <body bgcolor = "white" text = "black">
    We have lots of ideas for improvements to MLton, many of which we do not
    have time to implement, or at least haven't started on yet.  Here is a list
    of some of those improvements, ranging from the easy (1 week) to the
    difficult (several months).  If you have any interest in working on one of
    these, or some other improvement to MLton not listed here, please send mail
    to <tt>MLton at mlton.org</tt>.

    <ul> 
      <li> Optimizations
	<ul>
	  <li>Improved closure representation.
	    <br>
	    Right now, MLton's closure conversion algorithm uses a simple flat
	    closure to represent each function.
	  <li> Elimination of array bounds checks in loops.
	  <li> Elimination of overflow checks on array index computations.
	  <li> Common-subexpression elimination of repeated array subscripts.
	  <li> Loop-invariant code motion, especially for tuple selects.
	</ul>
      <li> Profiler.
	<ul>
	  <li> Relate to the source code.
	</ul>
      <li> Debugger.
	<br> Build one.
	<ul>
	  <li> It shouldn't be too hard to spit out stabs data similar to what
	    the profiler does now, relating to the SSA code.
	  <li> Relate to the source code
	</ul>
      <li> Port CML.
	<br> The support for threads and signals is already there, so
	it shouldn't be too hard to change the uses of callcc to
	MLton.thread.switch.  Harder is thinking about how to make MLton's
	libraries thread safe.
      <li> Libraries.
	<ul>
	  <li> Add support for 64 bit integers, and use them for file
	    positions.
	  <li> Interface to gtk+.
	  <li> Interface to OpenGL.
	  <li> Any useful additions to the <tt>MLton</tt> structure.
	  <li> Transform the compiler libraries used within MLton into generally
	    useful libraries.
	</ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
