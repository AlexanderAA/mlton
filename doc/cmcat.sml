 * This requires that you have SML/NJ installed.
 * It works with SML/NJ 110.9.1, and may require changes to work with other
 * versions, since it depends on the CM structure.
 *
 * cmcat takes a ".cm" file and prints on stdout a list of files in the order
 * deduced by CM.
 *
 * To use from the REPL, do the following:
 * Cmcat.cmcat {sources = "sources.cm",
 *	        out = TextIO.stdOut}
 *
 * Before using from the shell, you must do the following, where <smlnj> is
 * the root directory of the SML/NJ installation.  You may need to be root in
 * order to do these.
 * 1. From the SML/NJ REPL, call "export ();".  This creates a heap image
 *    "cmcat.x86-linux" in the local directory.
 * 2. ln -s <smlnj>/bin/.run-sml <smlnj>/bin/cmcat
 * 3. mv cmcat.x86-linux <smlnj>/bin/.heap
 *
 * Once it is installed, the usage is as follows:
 *   cmcat [-Dsym ...] sources.cm
 *
 * -Dsym can be used to define CM preprocessor symbols.
