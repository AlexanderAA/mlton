This release includes a native X86 code generator
(instead of using gcc), which leads to
significantly improved compile times and run
times for generated executables.  The release
also includes many bug fixes, including correct
raising of the Overflow exception for integer
arithmetic.  Finally, there are several new
modules in the MLton structure.
