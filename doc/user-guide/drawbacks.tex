\drawback{poor front-end type checking}
There is quite a bit of front-end type checking that is not done.  If
you feed {\mlton} a type-incorrect program, it might produce a terse
error message and exit or it might terminate and produce an
executable.  Note that this does not mean that the behavior of an
executable generated by {\mlton} is random.  It simply means that the
compiler may behave strangely for invalid SML programs.  The behavior
of {\mlton} for valid SML programs is well defined.

It is strongly recommended that you type check your programs with
another SML compiler before compiling them with {\mlton}.

\drawback{large compile-time memory requirement}
Because {\mlton} performs whole-program analysis and optimization,
compilation requires a large amount of memory on large programs.  For
example, compiling {\mlton} (over 100K lines) requires at least 256M
RAM.

\drawback{long compile times}
Whole-program compilation can take a long time on large programs.  For
example, compiling {\mlton} (over 100K lines) on an 1.6GhZ machine
takes roughly five minutes.

\drawback{no interactive top level}
Because of whole-program compilation, {\mlton} does not provide an
interactive top level.  In particular, it does not implement the {\tt
use} basis library function.
