\begin{description}

\drawback{relaxed type checking}
{\mlton} does SML-style polymorphic type inference.  However, type
inference happens after functor expansion, hence {\mlton} accepts more
programs than The Definition of SML allows.  {\mlton}'s type error
messages are also difficult to understand.  It is strongly recommended
that you type check your programs with another SML compiler before
compiling them with {\mlton}.

{\mlton} should always accept a valid SML program.  If it doesn't,
please send a bug report to {\mltonmail}.

\drawback{large compile-time memory requirement}
Because {\mlton} performs whole-program analysis and optimization,
compilation requires a large amount of memory on large programs.  For
example, compiling {\mlton} (over 100K lines) requires at least 256M
RAM.

\drawback{long compile times}
Whole-program compilation can take a long time on large programs.  For
example, compiling {\mlton} (over 100K lines) on an 1.6GhZ machine
takes roughly five minutes.

\drawback{no interactive top level}
Because of whole-program compilation, {\mlton} does not provide an
interactive top level.  In particular, it does not implement the {\tt
use} basis library function.
