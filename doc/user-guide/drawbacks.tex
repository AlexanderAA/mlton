\drawback{poor front-end type checking}
There is quite a bit of front-end type checking that is not done.  If
you feed {\mlton} a type-incorrect program, it might produce a terse
error message and exit or it might terminate and produce an
executable.  Note that this does not mean that the behavior of an
executable generated by {\mlton} is random.  It simply means that the
compiler may behave strangely for invalid SML programs.  The behavior
of {\mlton} for valid SML programs is well defined.

It is strongly recommended that you type check your programs with
another SML compiler before compiling them with {\mlton}.

\drawback{large run-time memory requirement}
{\mlton}'s runtime system uses a simple two-space stop-and-copy
collector.  By default, the runtime system automatically resizes the
heap and stack.  The collector works well for programs that allocate a
lot of ephemeral data, but not so well for programs with large
long-lived data.  Because of the collector, programs often require
more memory than with other SML compilers.  There are compile-time and
run-time options available to limit the heap usage of programs.  See
\secref{manual-page} for details.

\drawback{large compile-time memory requirement}
Because {\mlton} is self-hosting, when you are compiling using
{\mlton}, you are also running a {\mlton} generated executable.
Because of the large run-time memory requirement (see above) and the demands of
whole-program compilation, the compiler requires a large amount of memory while
compiling.

\drawback{long compile times}
Whole-program compilation often takes a long time.  For example, compiling
{\mlton} (over 100K lines) on an 1.6GhZ machine takes roughly five minutes.

\drawback{no interactive top level}
Because of whole-program compilation, {\mlton} does not provide an
interactive top level.  In particular, it does not implement the {\tt use} basis
library function.
