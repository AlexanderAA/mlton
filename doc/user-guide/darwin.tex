\subsec{Running on PowerPC/Darwin}{darwin}

Here are some things that may affect performance on PowerPC.

\begin{itemize}

\item
When compiling for PowerPC, {\mlton} only supports the C code
generator ({\tt -codegen c}).  Hence, performance is not as good as it
might be and compile times are longer.  Also, the quality of code
generated by {\tt gcc} is important.  By default, {\mlton} calls {\tt
gcc -O1}.  You can change this by calling {\mlton} with {\tt -cc-opt
-O2}.

\end{itemize}
