\subsec{Running on Cygwin/Windows}{cygwin}

{\mlton} uses the \htmladdnormallink{Cygwin}{http://www.cygwin.com/}
emulation layer to provide a Posix-like environment while running on a
Windows machine.  To run {\mlton} on Windows, you must first install
Cygwin on your machine.  To do this, visit the Cygwin site from your
Windows machine and run their {\tt setup.exe} script.  Then, you can
unpack the {\mlton} binary tgz in your Cygwin environment.

To run {\mlton} cross-compiled executables on Windows, you must
install the Cygwin {\tt dll} on the Windows machine.

Here are the known problems using {\mlton} on Cygwin.

\begin{itemize}

\item Time profiling is disabled.

\item Due to some recent Cygwin bugfixes involving fork/mmap, you must
use a Cygwin version from 2004-Jul-15 or later, which translates to a
release numbered 1.5.11-1 or higher.

\end{itemize}
