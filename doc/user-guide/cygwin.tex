\sec{Running on Cygwin/Windows}{cygwin}

{\mlton} uses the \htmladdnormallink{Cygwin}{http://www.cygwin.com/} emulation
layer to provide a Posix-like environment while running on a Windows machine.
To run {\mlton} on Windows, you must first install Cygwin on your machine.  To
do this, visit the Cygwin site from your Windows machine and run their {\tt
setup.exe} script.  Then, you can unpack the {\mlton} binary tgz in your Cygwin
environment.

{\mlton} under Cygwin mostly behaves like {\mlton} under Linux.  There are,
however, a few missing features and known problems.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Time profiling is disabled.

\item Due to several bugs in Cygwin's emulation of {\tt fork}, {\tt
Posix.Process.fork} is disabled.  Any use of {\tt fork} will raise
{\tt OS.SysErr}.  For idiomatic uses of {\tt fork} plus {\tt exec},
you can instead use the {\tt MLton.Process.spawn} family of functions, which
work on both Cygwin and Linux.

\item We have seen some strangeness in Cygwin's emulation of signals and
signal handlers, but have not been able to pin it down.

\end{enumerate}
