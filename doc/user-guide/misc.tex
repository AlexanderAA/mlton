\subsection{{\tt cmcat}}

The MLton distribution includes the SML sources for a utility,
{\tt cmcat}, that allows one to create whole SML programs if you
have developed using {\smlnj} and the 
\htmladdnormallink{Compilation Manager (CM)}
		  {http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/doc/CM/index.htm}
See {\tt doc/cmcat.sml} for details.  Building {\tt cmcat}
requires that you have already installed {\smlnj}.
