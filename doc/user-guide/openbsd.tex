\subsec{Running on OpenBSD}{openbsd}

Here are the known problems using {\mlton} on OpenBSD.

\begin{itemize}

\item Our socket regression test fails.  We suspect this is not a bug
and is simply due to our test relying on a certain behavior when
connecting to a socket that has not yet accepted, which is handled
differently on OpenBSD than other platforms.  Any help in
understanding and resolving this issue is appreciated.

\end{itemize}
