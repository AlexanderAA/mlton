\subsection{Unresolved bugs}

This section lists the known unresolved bugs in MLton.

\begin{itemize}

\item
{\mlton} rejects datatype declarations with type variables bound at
an outer level.  For example, the following program is rejected,
although it is consistent with the Definition.
\begin{verbatim}
fun 'a f (x : 'a) =
   let datatype foo = Foo of 'a * int
   in 13
   end
\end{verbatim}
This may be an oversight in the Definition of SML, since unchecked use
of this feature can lead to type unsoundness.

\item
{\mlton} allows local type names to escape their scope, as in
\begin{verbatim}
let
   datatype t = T
in
   T
end
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}
