\subsec{Running on MinGW/Windows}{mingw}

Here are the known problems using {\mlton} on MinGW.

\begin{itemize}

\item Many of the {\tt Posix} functions are unimplemented and will
{\tt raise SysErr}.

\item {\tt MLton.Itimer} is unimplemented.

\item The C function {\tt getrusage} is implemented by a stub that
always sets the time to zero.  Hence {\tt MLton.Rusage.rusage} will
return times of zero.  Also, the times printed by the runtime system
will be zeroes.

\end{itemize}
