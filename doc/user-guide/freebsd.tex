\sec{Running on FreeBSD}{freebsd}

We have noticed a few issues when running {\mlton} on FreeBSD.  

\begin{itemize}

\item The executables often run more slowly than on a comparable Linux machine.
We conjecture that part of this is due to costs due to heap resizing and kernel
zeroing of pages.

\end{itemize}

We have also noticed a few issues when compiling {\mlton} on FreeBSD.  These
only arise if you are working with the {\mlton} sources.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\mlton} {\tt Makefile}s use GNU extensions, so you should use {\tt gmake}
instead of {\tt make}.

\end{itemize}
