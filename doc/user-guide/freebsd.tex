\sec{Running on FreeBSD}{freebsd}

We have noticed a few issues when running {\mlton} on FreeBSD.  

\begin{itemize}

\item
The executables often run more slowly than on a comparable Linux
machine.  We conjecture that part of this is due to costs due to heap
resizing and kernel zeroing of pages.  Any help in solving the problem
would be appreciated.

\end{itemize}

We have also noticed a few issues when compiling {\mlton} on FreeBSD.  These
only arise if you are working with the {\mlton} sources.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\mlton} {\tt Makefile}s use GNU extensions, so you should use {\tt gmake}
instead of {\tt make}.

\item {\mlton} requires GNU MP version 3 or higher.  The default that comes with
FreeBSD is version 2.  Building MLton's runtime will attempt to copy
{\tt gmp.h} and {\tt libgmp.a} to the {\tt runtime} directory from the {\mlton}
binary package for FreeBSD ({\tt /\prefix/lib/mlton/self/libgmp.a} and {\tt
/\prefix/lib/mlton/self/include/gmp.h}).  You can also get them by
downloading them from \htmlurl{http://www.gnu.org/software/gmp/gmp.html} and
compiling yourself (we use version 4.0.1).
\end{itemize}
