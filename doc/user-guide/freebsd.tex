\sec{Running on FreeBSD}{freebsd}

We have noticed a few issues when running {\mlton} on FreeBSD.  These
only arise if you are working with the {\mlton} sources.

\begin{itemize}

%\item Because some of the {\mlton} scripts use bash, you may have to add a
%symbolic link from {\tt /bin/bash} to {\tt /usr/local/bin/bash}.

\item {\mlton} {\tt Makefile}s use GNU extensions, so you should use {\tt gmake}
instead of {\tt make}.

\end{itemize}
