\sec{Manual page}{manual-page}

{\mlton} is run from the command line with a collection of options
followed by a file name and a list of files to compile, assemble, and
link with.
\begin{verbatim}
mlton [option ...] file.{cm|sml|c|o} [file.{c|S|o} ...]
\end{verbatim}
The simplest case is to run {\tt mlton foo.sml}, where {\tt foo.sml}
contains a valid SML program, in which case {\mlton} compiles the
program to produce an executable {\tt foo}.  Since {\mlton} has
no notion of separate compilation, the program must be the entire
program you wish to compile.  However, the program may refer to
signatures and structures defined in the SML basis library.

For developing large programs spanning many files, {\mlton} supports a
limited subset of SML/NJ Compilation Manager (CM) files.  For example,
{\tt mlton foo.cm} will compile the complete SML program consisting of
the concatenatation of all the SML files referred to (either directly
or indirectly) by {\tt foo.cm}.  See \secref{cm} for details.

\subsec{Compile-time options}{compile-time-options}

{\mlton}'s options allow you to control the name of the output file,
the verbosity of compile-time messages, and whether or not certain
optimizations are performed.  They also allow you to specify which
intermediate files are saved and to stop the compilation process
early, at some intermediate pass, in which case compilation can be
resumed by passing the resulting files to {\mlton}.  {\mlton} uses the
input file suffix to determine the type of input program.  The
possibilities are {\tt .cm}, {\tt .sml}, {\tt .c}, {\tt .S} and {\tt
.o}.

With no arguments, {\mlton} prints the version number and exits.  For
a usage message, run {\mlton} with an invalid switch, e.g. {\tt mlton
-z}.  In the explanation below and in the usage message, for flags
that take a boolean argument {\tt \{true|false\}}, the first value
listed is the default.  For example, by default, overflow checking on
is performed on integer arithmetic.

\newcommand{\option}[1]{\item[{\tt #1}]\hspace{1em}\\}

\begin{description}

\newcommand{\choices}{{\it \{}}
\newcommand{\choice}{{\it |}}
\renewcommand{\choice}{|}
\newcommand{\choicesEnd}{{\it \}}}
\newcommand{\choiceTwo}[2]{\choices #1\choice #2\choicesEnd}
\newcommand{\choiceThree}[3]{\choices #1\choice #2\choice #3\choicesEnd}
\newcommand{\choiceFour}[4]{\choices #1\choice #2\choice #3\choice #4\choicesEnd}
\newcommand{\falseTrue}{\choiceTwo{false}{true}}
\newcommand{\trueFalse}{\choiceTwo{true}{false}}

\option{-align \choiceTwo{4}{8}}
Aligns object sizes and doubles in memory by the specified alignment.
On {\intel}, the default is {\tt 4} and on {\sparc} the default is
{\tt 8}.

\option{-basis \choices 2002\choice 2002-strict\choice 1997\choice none\choicesEnd}
Selects a Basis Library to be used by the input program.  {\tt 2002}
and {\tt 2002-strict} implement the 2002 Basis Library
specification; {\tt 2002-strict} removes all extensions described in
\secref{mlton}.  {\tt 1997} implements the 1997 version of the Basis
Library specification; see \secref{basis1997} for more information.
{\tt none} removes all Basis Library functionality.

\option{-cc-opt {\it option}}
Pass the option to gcc for compiling C code.  This is only useful when
compiling {\tt -native false}.

\option{-detect-overflow \trueFalse}
This flag controls whether or not overflow checking is performed on integer
arithmetic, in particular on {\tt Int.\{+,-,*,\~{},div,quot\}}.

\option{-exn-history \falseTrue}
Enable {\tt Exn.history}.  See \secref{exn} for details.  There is a
performance cost to {\tt -exn-history true}, both in memory usage of
exceptions and in run time, because of additional work that must be
performed at each exception construction, raise, and handle.

\option{-export-header \falseTrue}
This flag is useful for programs that use {\export} expressions (see
\secref{export}).  It causes {\mlton} to output to standard output a C
header file with prototypes for all of the functions exported from
SML.

\option{-ieee-fp \falseTrue}
Control whether or not the native code generator is pedantic about following
the IEEE floating point standard.  By default, it is not, because of the
performance cost.  This has no effect with {\tt -native false}.

\option{-inline {\it n}}
Set the inlining threshold used in the optimizer.  The default is 320.

\option{-keep \choiceThree{g}{o}{sml}}
Save the intermediate file(s) corresponding to the given arg.  If
no {\tt -keep} argument is given, then only the final file(s) is saved.\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\tt g} & generated {\tt .S} and {\tt .c} files passed to gcc and the assembler\\
{\tt o} & object files\\
{\tt sml} & SML file\\
\end{tabular}

\option{-link-opt {\it opt}}
Pass the option to {\tt gcc} when linking.  You can use this to
specify library search paths, e.g. {\tt -link-opt -Lpath}, and
libraries to link with, e.g. {\tt -link-opt -lfoo}, or even both at
the same time, e.g. {\tt -link-opt '-Lpath -lfoo'}.  If you wish to
pash an option to the linker, you must use {\tt gcc}'s {\tt -Wl,}
syntax, e.g., {\tt -link-opt '-Wl,--export-dynamic'}.

\option{-may-load-world \trueFalse}
Controls whether or not the generated executable supports the {\tt
load-world} runtime system option.

\option{-native \trueFalse}
Controls whether or not to use native code generation, as opposed to
generating C and using {\tt gcc}.  With native code generation,
{\mlton} typically compiles more quickly and generates better code.

\option{-output {\it file}}
Specify the name of the final output file. The default name is the
input file name with its suffix removed and an appropriate suffix
added.

\option{-profile \choiceThree{no}{alloc}{time}}
Produce an executable that will gather allocation or time profiling
information.  When such an executable is run, it will produce an {\tt
mlmon.out} file.  See \secref{profiling} for details.

\option{-profile-stack \falseTrue}
If true, the profiler will count the time spent (or bytes allocated)
while a function is on the stack.

\option{-runtime {\it arg}}
Pass argument to the runtime via {\tt @MLton}.  The argument will be
processed before other {\tt @MLton} command line switches.  Multiple
uses of {\tt -runtime} are allowed, and will pass all the arguments in
order.

\option{-safe \trueFalse}
This switch determines the value of the SML variable {\tt MLton.safe},
which controls whether the basis library performs array, string, and
vector bounds checks, division for zero checks, and other checks.
Compiling {\tt -safe false} changes the behavior of some programs,
does not conform to the basis library specification, and may cause
programs to seg fault.

\option{-show-basis \falseTrue}
If true, the compiler shows the basis library and exits.

\option{-show-basis-used \falseTrue}
If true, then the compiler prints out the types, values, signatures,
structures, and functors from the basis library that the input program
uses, and then exits.

\option{-static \falseTrue}
If true, then produce a statically linked executable.  This option
only affects linking.

\option{-stop \choiceFour{f}{g}{o}{sml}}
Secify pass to stop at.\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\tt f} & list of files on stdout (only makes sense when input is {\tt foo.cm})\\
{\tt g} & generated {\tt .S} and {\tt .c} files\\
{\tt o} & object file\\
{\tt sml} & SML file (only makes sense when input is {\tt foo.cm})\\
{\tt tc} & after type checking\\
\end{tabular}\\
If you compile {\tt -stop g} or {\tt -stop o}, you can resume
compilation by running {\tt mlton} on the generated {\tt .c} and {\tt
.S} or {\tt .o} files. 

\option{-target \choiceTwo{self}{\ldots}}
Generate an executable that runs on the specified platform.  The default
is {\tt self}, which means to compile for the machine that {\mlton} is
running on.  To use any other target, you must first install a
cross-compiler.  See \secref{cross-compiling}.

\option{-verbose \choiceFour{0}{1}{2}{3}}
How verbose to be about what passes are running.  The default is 0.\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\tt 0} & silent\\
{\tt 1} & calls to compiler, assembler, and linker\\
{\tt 2} & 1 + intermediate compiler passes\\
{\tt 3} & 2 + some data structure sizes\\
\end{tabular}\\

\end{description}

\subsec{Runtime system options}{runtime-options}

To control the runtime system, executables produced by {\mlton} take
several optional command line arguments before their usual arguments.
To use these options, the first argument to the executable must be
\verb+@MLton+.  The optional arguments then follow, must be
terminated by \verb+--+, and are followed by any arguments to the program.
The optional arguments are {\em not} made available to the SML
program via {\tt CommandLine.arguments}.  For example, a valid call
to {\tt hello-world} is: 
\begin{verbatim}
hello-world @MLton gc-summary fixed-heap 10k -- a b c
\end{verbatim}
In the above example, {\tt CommandLine.arguments () = ["a", "b",
"c"]}.

\begin{description}
\option{fixed-heap \mbox{\rm n[}km\mbox{\rm ]}}
 Use a fixed size heap of {\tt n} bytes.
 A trailing {\tt k} means that {\tt n} is in units of 1024 bytes. 
 A trailing {\tt m} means that {\tt n} is in units of 1,048,576 bytes. 
 If neither appear, then {\tt n} is in bytes.
 A value of {\tt 0} means to use almost all the RAM present on the
 machine.

\option{gc-messages}
Print a message at the start and end of every garbage collection.

\option{gc-summary}
Print a summary of garbage collection statistics upon program
termination.

\option{load-world \mbox{\rm world}}
Restart the computation with the file specified by world.
The world file must have been created by a call to
{\tt MLton.World.save} by the same executable.  See \secref{world}
for details.

\option{max-heap \mbox{\rm n[}km\mbox{\rm ]}}
Run the computation with an automatically resized heap that is never
larger than n.  The meaning of [{\tt km}] is the same as with the
{\tt fixed-heap} option.

\option{no-load-world}
Disable {\tt load-world}.  Can use this with the {\tt -runtime}
compiler switch to prevent executables from loading a world.

\option{ram-slop {\mbox{\rm x}}}
Multiply {\tt x} by the amount of RAM on the machine to obtain what
the runtime views as the amount of RAM it can use.
\end{description}
These options can also control the compiler, as in
\begin{verbatim}
mlton @MLton fixed-heap 100m -- foo.sml
\end{verbatim}
