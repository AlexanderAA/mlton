The current release of MLton does not support Unicode.  We are working on adding support. 
    <ul>

    <li>
<p>
 <tt>WideChar</tt> structure. 
</p>
</li>
    <li>
<p>
 UTF-8 encoded source files. 
</p>
</li>

    </ul>


<p>
There is no real support for Unicode in the Definition of Standard ML; there are only a few throw-away sentences allong the lines of "ASCII must be a subset of the character set in programs". 
</p>
<p>
Neither is there real support for Unicode in the Standard ML Basis Library.  The general consensus (which includes the opinions of the editors of the Basis Library) is that the <tt>WideChar</tt> structure is insufficient for the purposes of Unicode.  There is no <tt>LargeChar</tt> structure, which in itself is a deficiency, since a programmer can not program against the largest supported character size. 
</p>
<p>
MLton has some preliminary support for 16 and 32 bit characters and strings.  It is even possible to include arbitrary Unicode characters in 32-bit strings using a <tt>\Uxxxxxxxx</tt> escape sequence.  (This longer escape sequence is a minor extension over the Definition which only allows <tt>\uxxxx</tt>.)  This is by no means completely satisfactory in terms of support for Unicode, but it is what is currently available. 
</p>
<p>
There are periodic flurries of questions and discussion about Unicode in  SML/MLton.  The most recent, which did lead to some seemingly sound design  decisions, was in December 2004. 
</p>
<p>
The discussion started at: 
</p>

            <ul>

Stephen posted a good summary of points at:

            </ul>


<p>
and the discussion continued. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="fxp">fxp</a> XML parser has some support for dealing with Unicode documents.
