Here is a list of companies, projects, and courses that use or have
used MLton.  If you use MLton and are not here, please add your
project with a brief description and a link.  Thanks.

== Companies ==

* http://www.hardcoreprocessing.com/[Hardcore Processing] uses MLton as a http://www.hardcoreprocessing.com/Freeware/MLTonWin32.html[crosscompiler from Linux to Windows] for graphics and game software.
** http://www.cex3d.net/[CEX3D Converter], a conversion program for 3D objects.
** http://www.hardcoreprocessing.com/company/showreel/index.html[Interactive Showreel], which contains a crossplatform GUI-toolkit and a realtime renderer for a subset of RenderMan written in Standard ML.
** various http://www.hardcoreprocessing.com/entertainment/index.html[games]
* http://www.polyspace.com/[PolySpace Technologies] builds their product that detects runtime errors in embedded systems based on abstract interpretation.
* http://www.sourcelight.com/[Sourcelight Technologies] uses MLton internally for prototyping and for processing databases as part of their system that makes personalized movie recommendations.
* http://www.reactive-systems.com/[Reactive Systems] uses MLton to build Reactis, a model-based testing and validation package used in the automotive and aerospace industries.

== Projects ==

* http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/hamlet/[HaMLet], a model implementation of Standard ML.
* http://code.google.com/p/kepler-code/[KeplerCode], independent verification of the computational aspects of proofs of the Kepler conjecture and the Dodecahedral conjecture.
* http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jeh1004/research/metis/[Metis], a first-order prover used in the http://hol.sourceforge.net/[HOL4 theorem proving system].
* http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tom7misc/net/mlftpd[mlftpd], an ftp daemon written in SML.  <:TomMurphy:> is also working on http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tom7misc/net/[replacements for standard network services] in SML.  He also uses MLton to build his entries (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/icfp2001/[2001], http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/icfp2002/[2002], http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/icfp2004/[2004], http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/icfp2005/[2005]) in the annual ICFP programming contest.

* http://www.ida.liu.se/~pelab/rml/[RML], a system for developing, compiling and debugging and teaching structural operational semantics (SOS) and natural semantics specifications.
* http://www2.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rahli/cgi-bin/slicer/index.html[SMLTES], a type-error slicer for SML
* http://www.cis.ksu.edu/~allen/smlnjtrans.html[SMLNJtrans], a program for generating SML/NJ transcripts in LaTeX.
* http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/%7Etom7/ssapre/[SSA PRE], an implementation of Partial Redundancy Elimination for MLton.

* http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/winter/ShiftLab/TL_web/TL_index.html[TL System], providing general-purpose support for rewrite-based transformation over elements belonging to a (user-defined) domain language.
* http://www.laas.fr/tina[Tina] (Time Petri net Analyzer)
* http://www.twelf.org/[Twelf] an implementation of the LF logical framework.
* http://regiment.us[WaveScript], part of the http://wavescope.csail.mit.edu/[WaveScope] sensor network project.  Produces MLton code in backend.  http://www.lecs.cs.ucla.edu/~girod/aensbox/[Used on embedded devices.]
