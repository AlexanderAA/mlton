MLton is a whole-program optimizing compiler for
Standard ML that runs on X86 machines under
Linux.  MLton generates standalone executables
with good runtime performance, is SML 97
compliant, and has a mostly complete basis
library.  MLton has support for profiling and a
fast C FFI.  MLton has additional libraries for
continuations, interval timers, random numbers,
signal handlers, sockets, system logging,
threads, and heap save and restore.  It also has
a fast implementation of IntInf based on the GNU
multiprecision library.
