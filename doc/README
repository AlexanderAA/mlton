     o PowerPC: Debian, Mac OSX
     o X86: Linux, Cygwin/Windows, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
     o Sparc: Debian, Solaris.
   + Generates standalone executables with excellent running times.
   + Supports the full SML 97 language.
   + A complete basis library matching the latest specification.
   + Untagged native integers and words.
   + Unboxed reals.
   + Unboxed arrays
   + Fast C FFI for calling from SML to C and from C to SML.
   + Source-level profiling of both time and allocation.
   + Multiple garbage collection strategies.
   + Support for large amounts of memory (up to 4G), large arrays (up
     to 2G elements), and large files (using 64-bit integers for file
     positions).
   + Fast IntInf based on the GNU multiprecision library (gmp).
