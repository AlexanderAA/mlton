   + SML 97 compliant, with a mostly complete basis library 
   + Fast IntInf based on the GNU multiprecision library (gmp) 
   + Fast C FFI 
   + Profiling 
   + Libraries for continuations, interval timers, random numbers,
       resource limits, resource usage, signal handlers, sockets, system
       logging, threads, and heap save and restore
