 * This pass is based on the liveness algorithm described in section 4.13,
 * page 132, of Morgan's "Building and Optimizing Compiler".  BTW, the Dragon
 * book and Muchnick's book provided no help at all on speeding up liveness.
 * They suggest using bit-vectors, which is infeasible for MLton due to the
 * large size of and number of variables in CPS functions.
 *
 * Here is a description of the algorithm.
 *
 * Walk over the whole program and
 * 1. Build the predecessor graph of basic blocks.  Each basic block records the
 *    set of its predecessors and the set of variables live at the beginning of
 *    the block.
 * 2. For each variable record the block in which is defined and the list of
 *    blocks where it is used.
 *
 * Now, for each variable, propagate the liveness information backwards from uses
 * along basic blocks until the definition block is reached.
 *
 * That's it.  The reason why it's so fast is that it processes one variable at a
 * time, and hence the operation to determine if that variable is in the live
 * list for a particular block is constant time -- the variable is either at the
 * head of the list or it's not there.
